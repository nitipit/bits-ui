# Icon

Packet UI doesn't include icon pack with it's distribution since there're a lot of icon packs for developer to choose already.  
These are some recommendations.
- [Adwaita Icon Web](https://nitipit.github.io/adwaita-icon-web/) : This is the icons set we use on **Packet UI** website.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) : The most popular icon pack.
- [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/) : Font & SVG icons which provides great tools to generate custom icons.
